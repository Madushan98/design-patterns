# Design Patterns!

Some of the finest practices adopted by seasoned object-oriented software engineers are represented by design patterns. In object-oriented systems, a design pattern is a systematic way of naming, motivating, and explaining a generic design solution. It outlines the issue, the fix, when to use it, and any negative effects. Additionally, it offers examples and implementation advice.


## Types Of Design Patterns

-   **Creational patterns**
	-  
    1.  Factory Method Pattern
    2.  Abstract Factory Pattern
    3.  Singleton Pattern
    4.  Prototype Pattern
    5.  Builder Pattern
    6.  Object Pool Pattern
    
-   **Structural patterns** 
	-  
     1.  Adapter.
     2.  Bridge.
     3.  Filter.
     4.  Composite.
     5.  Decorator.
     6.  Facade.
     7.  Flyweight.
     8.  Proxy.
     
-   **Behavioral patterns**
	-  
	  1.  Chain of Responsibility Pattern
	  2.  Command Pattern
	  3.  Interpreter Pattern
	  4.  Iterator Pattern
